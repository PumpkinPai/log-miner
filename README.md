# log-miner
Unfinished: This will be my attempt to scrape data from my logseq notebook and generate some csv's that can go into a spreadsheet.  

Maybe even create invoices from the TODO :logbook: entries.

### Roadmap
  + [ ] create the crawly bits
  + [ ] create the user prompts for search terms
  + [ ] make it work
  + [ ] make some documentation or a sweet gui
